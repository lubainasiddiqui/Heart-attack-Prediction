# Heart-failure-Classification
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, accounting for 31% of all fatalities worldwide. CVDs are a common cause of heart failure, and this dataset contains 12 variables that can be used to predict heart failure mortality.   Most cardiovascular illnesses can be avoided by implementing population-wide strategies to address behavioural risk factors such cigarette use, poor diet and obesity, physical inactivity, and problematic alcohol consumption.  People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the existence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or previously established disease) require early detection and management, which can be greatly aided by a machine learning model.
